- spherical cutoff in G space for Gaussians
- exchange part of Fock matrix for k-points
- FIX numpy.ComplexWarning for SCF if kpt != 0; SCF may not work
  for kpt shifted away from Gamma point
- Change Mole class check, so that can run KRKS calculations so long
  as nelec * ncell is even (e.g. 4 H atoms) (may need to shift kpts to cell)

Notes on pseudopotentials:
 - Some analogies:
     pyscf.gto           ---   pyscf.pbc
     gto.Mole            ---   pbc.Cell
     gto/mole.py         ---   pbc/cell.py
     Mole.format_basis   ---   Cell.format_pseudo
     gto.basis           ---   pbc.pseudo
     basis.parse_nwchem  ---   pseudo.parse_cp2k
