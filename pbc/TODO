- spherical cutoff in G space for Gaussians
  [partially done. Does not work with k-points, figure out how to do.
   Simple cutoff for (G+K)^2 does not seem right, but check]

- exchange part of Fock matrix for k-points
- FIX numpy.ComplexWarning for SCF if kpt != 0; SCF may not work
  for kpt shifted away from Gamma point
- Change Mole class check, so that can run KRKS calculations so long
  as nelec * ncell is even (e.g. 4 H atoms) (may need to shift kpts to cell)

DONE(TCB):
x Streamline cell construction 
  x add 'precision' to cell, use to set nimgs, ewald parameters in build()

  (Poisson)
  [can use: 
       constant charge for usual PBC
       compensating 1/r charge if density vanishes at boundary (e.g. molecule)
       possibly grid of Gaussians for PBC with lots of vacuum]

- Add atomic-based grids for PBC

- Clean-up, document, and integrate: 
    scf/kscf.py
    df/df.py

- Decide on best place for remaining tools/pbc.py functions:
    fft/ifft
    get_coulG

- Store coords/aoR?
